This is a flashbang script that was scripted for FiveM. Basically you just throw it and wherever it explosed it causes any player near it to collapse with some screen effects.

# Changelog: Eddie (EddboxLP)
1. Explosion now checks for line of sight towards players face to trigger all effects.
2. Beeing too close to the explosion now causes damage to the player.
3. Effects now stack properly after consecutive hits. That includes increasing effect timers and effect severity.
4. More options have been added to the config to facilitate all changes.

# Known Bugs
1. Weapon is named Tear Gas (I don't know metas well enough to fix it)
2. Weapon has smoke on it when thrown (It is another part that I have no idea how to fix)
3. Weapon has a timer to hold it (No idea how to fix that either)
