This is a flashbang script that was scripted for FiveM. Basically you just throw it and wherever it explosed it causes any player near it to collapse with some screen effects.

# Changelog (14.10.2021) by Eddie
1. Explosion now checks for line of sight towards players face to trigger the effect respective to the player.
2. Beeing too close to the flashbang causes damage to the player.
3. Effect now stacks properly. That means multiple consecutive hits will increase the time of the effect.

# Known Bugs
1. Weapon is named Tear Gas (I don't know metas well enough to fix it)
2. Weapon has smoke on it when thrown (It is another part that I have no idea how to fix)
3. Weapon has a timer to hold it (No idea how to fix that either)
